# Vue Cave
This open-source project aims to provide documentation for anything primarily built with Vue!

This repository also wants to help junior devs gain the insight they need when working with an open-source project. With contributions, junior devs finally get to experience what it is like working on another repository other than their own. There will be plenty of new features to add and improvements. All of that will be managed by me (Silas Huereca) to help junior devs gain real-world experience so that they can finally beef up their resume and confidence!
